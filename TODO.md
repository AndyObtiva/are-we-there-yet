Questions:

- Are the project in the Gantt Chart arranged alphabetical or by date entry?
- Can we have the duration in the Gant Chart calculated same way as mentioned in the information below? Meaning if it’s in a weekly duration in the bottom to be written in weekly as well in the Gantt Chart? (Now it’s days up and weeks in the column)
- Would it be possible In the future to have a feature as an option of appearing on the Gant Chart only a specific project? That helps ,me to take a screen shot and use ot as a reference when I am discussing a project with someone, without showing the rest of the projects. It’s not essential but would be helpful.

Tasks:

- Make it a mini-icon always-on app (e.g. on app it's a top-menu-bar mini-icon) that can be brought on easily with a shortcut
